Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?


The primary focus of our project during the course was DriverPass, an initiative aimed at tackling the problem of inadequate driving education. Based on extensive research, it was found that over 65% of individuals fail their driving tests at the DMV. In light of this, our goal was to enhance driver training by offering online courses and live instruction. The aim was to provide a comprehensive learning experience that improves the chances of success for aspiring drivers.

What did you do particularly well?


This course has greatly enhanced my ability to analyze systems and effectively convey abstract ideas through visual representations. The diagrams I created, including class diagrams, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, and data flow diagrams, have proven to be invaluable in providing clarity and understanding. I am confident in the quality of my diagramming skills and believe that they have significantly contributed to my overall comprehension of complex concepts.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?


I know that I can make my UML class diagram better by improving the documented methods. It was easy to include the accessor methods, but I need to think more about how the different classes work together and how they meet the needs of the system users. Adding more methods that cover these ideas would be really helpful in making my diagram even better!

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


When designing the system, I always kept the user needs in mind. I created diagrams that showed how users would interact with the system. For the class diagram, I looked at the sequence and activity diagrams to understand how each class would be used. It's important to think about user needs because if we don't, the system design might be too confusing and not actually solve the problems it's supposed to.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

One of the coolest things I learned in this course is the iterative design approach. Instead of trying to get everything perfect right away, I focus on making multiple passes over a project. Each time I go through it, I learn more and add more details. It's like taking small steps to make something better each time. I'm excited to keep practicing this technique in my future projects.
